# Negation Structures in Sentiment Analysis

This tool creates a DistilBERT sentiment analysis model and test different input databases on this model.

Each database is different from each other in that they consist of different ratios of negation structures, namely sentential negation and constituent negation.

With the preprocess tool and the model script, different databases can be fed into the tool and results can be obtained.
